Integrate Google Signin for Android Client
==========================================

1) Create a [Configuration](https://developers.google.com/mobile/add?platform=android&cntapi=signin&cnturl=https:%2F%2Fdevelopers.google.com%2Fidentity%2Fsign-in%2Fandroid%2Fsign-in%3Fconfigured%3Dtrue&cntlbl=Continue%20Adding%20Sign-In) File for your application.
NOTE: Add package name, SHA1 of keystore and select Google Signin service. Finally generate configuration file.

2) Copy generated google-services.json file to app/ folder.

3) For different build flavors - We must create SHA1(as different keystore used), and use different package names when generating configuration file (google-services.json).


Responses for Add service, GET redirect url and Remove service
==============================================================

These responses are generated by Account Manager/Subscription service depending on success/failure.

1) Add service
```json
{  
   "clientAction":{  
      "serverClientId":"SERVER_CLIENT_ID required for getting auth code",
      "updateTokenUrl":"We can use redirect url same way inapp browser GET call",
      "scopes":[  
         "Array of scopes"
      ]
   }
}
```

2) GET Redirect url call (success or Failure) - We can use "introSpeakOut" as response

3) Remove service - We can use "introSpeakOut" as response
